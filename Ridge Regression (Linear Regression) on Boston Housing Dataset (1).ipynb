    "Ridge regression is a linear regression in which the coefficients (w) are chosen  to predict training set as well as to fit an additional constraint. The magnitude of the coefficients are small enough near zero (0). Due to small coefficient, the features play a little influence on the model though the prediction is well enough. The constrain fitting by the Ridge regression is know as regularization. It restricts a model to avoid overfitting. The most common regularization by Ridge is known as L2 regularization. "
